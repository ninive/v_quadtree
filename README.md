## v-quadtree 

A recursive quadtree data-structure module implemented in V which is helpful in simplifying collision detection in a game, general image compression/de-noising, and other filtering use cases. 

I've included a simple demo to show how to use the module and how it works in real-time. You can move the cursor with the mouse and see the optimal collision filtering.
